        <h1>What is "What's Up Doc"?</h1>
        <p>What's Up Doc is a my senior project during my last semester at Lebanese International University. The purpose 
            of this project was to fascilitate the process of booking appointments with your doctor. I started working on this project at the beginning of the Spring 2019 semester.
            Front End and Back End Development were performed my myself and the process took around 3 months.
